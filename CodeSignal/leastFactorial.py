'''
Given an integer n, find the minimal k such that

k = m! (where m! = 1 * 2 * ... * m) for some integer m;
k >= n.
In other words, find the smallest factorial which is not less than n.

Example

For n = 17, the output should be
solution(n) = 24.

17 < 24 = 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4, while 3! = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 < 17).
'''

def solution(n):
    k, m = 1, 1
    while k < n:
        k = m * k
        m += 1
        
    return k
